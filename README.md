# saker.java.ide.eclipse

An Eclipse IDE plugin for applying Java project configurations based on build results from the [saker.build system](https://saker.build). The plugin uses the extension point provided by the [saker.build.ide.eclipse](https://github.com/sakerbuild/saker.build.ide.eclipse) to automatically configure Java project and pass the JRE runtime configurations to the build.

You can install the plugin from the same update-site as the [saker.build.ide.eclipse](https://saker.build/saker.build/doc/eclipseplugin.html) plugin.
